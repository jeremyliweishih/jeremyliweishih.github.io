	<h1>About Me</h1>
	<p> 
		I was born in Taipei, Taiwan but moved to Shanghai at the age of one. I spent most of my childhood in Shanghai American School but left for Beijing when I was in third grade. There I went to the International School of Beijing until I reached the seventh grade. Then I returned back to Shanghai American School to complete my high school education. Currently I am pursuing a Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and a Bachelor of Arts in Economics. On campus I'm part of the Taiwanese Association of Students at Tufts, Tufts Club Hockey, and Tufts Financial Group. My passions include playing and watching ice hockey, music from genres such as punk rock, metal, dubstep, and progressive house, and video games such as Dota 2.
